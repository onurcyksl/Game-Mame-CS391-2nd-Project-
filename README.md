CS 391 2nd Project
In this project, we want to make a helpful site for gamers. Gamers can find a game that they want to play and check their information and descriptions. People can also log in. For example, you want to play a game called "Super Hot" but you don't owe VR Setup. You go and check the related page with "Super Hot". You see that it is VR exclusive game. You decided to not buy this game or buy VR. We did this project Onurcan Yüksel(S017647), Ege Çapar(S017764) and Bora Kayabey(S015003). Onurcan Yüksel did the part which related to login-sign-up. He makes connections with local storage and our login-signup system. Also, he did the form that people can register and log in. Ege did the parts related to the data. He made the connections between classes and make the data can be useful from the required pages. Bora did the design of the web page. He did the UI elements and make the website look better. For starting the project you should clone this repository. Then you have to make the installations. with "npm install" after installations complete, write "npm start" and the page automatically display. We did not use any external libraries. We use react-bootstrap and react-router.
